# Spark Experience Toolkit - Tokens

Design tokens are the lowest abstraction of the design system, a token cannot be broken down futher hense the icon is a [Quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark). A Quark is a subatomic particle with no sub structure, thus not composed of other particles. The same applies to a Design token, they cannot be broken down futher or made up from other things. Design tokens are hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or secound values for animation) in order to maintain a scalable and consisent visual system for UI Development.
