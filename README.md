# Base - Tokens

Design tokens are the lowest abstraction of the design system, a token cannot be broken down futher or made up from other things. Design tokens are hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or secound values for animation) in order to maintain a scalable and consisent visual system for UI Development. This Repo is design to be forked, its a template repo. This hopefully makes it so across our different brands theres naming consistency and tool consistency.


# Implementation
We use [Styled Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) and follow the recommend CTI (Category/Type/Item) structure.
